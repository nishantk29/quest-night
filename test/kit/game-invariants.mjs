// game-invariants.mjs: shared game-rules test kit for the Game Night family (node:test, no dependencies, Node 20+).
// Shared across the Game Night repos. Copy it UNCHANGED into a repo's test/kit/ and write a small
// adapter for that game in test/game-invariants.test.js.
//
// Four properties, each a node:test test, checked over seeded random games:
//   1. over is terminal: once a game is over, no in-game action changes the game (only the adapter's
//      `resetActions`, such as Restart or Play again, may leave the end screen).
//   2. no step can block: in every reachable state before the end, at least one progress action is accepted,
//      the host's fallback (skip) is accepted when the adapter names one, and every game ends within maxSteps.
//   3. no leaks (non-interference): a player's view must not change when the secrets that player may not know are
//      shuffled among the other players. The adapter says what a viewer may know through `knowledgeClass`.
//   4. no Undo after game over: Undo on the end screen is refused and changes nothing.
//
// Adapter contract (all functions receive the kit's seeded rng where randomness is needed):
//   name                          string, used in test names
//   cases                         array of case objects (table sizes, options); games rotate through them
//   setup(c, rng)                 -> state: a dealt game, ready to play
//   apply(state, actor, msg, rng, now) -> { ok, state }   must not mutate its input when ok is false.
//                                 Mutating reducers: clone inside the adapter (the kit also passes clones).
//   isOver(state)                 -> boolean
//   progress(state, rng)          -> [[actor, msg], ...] candidate moves that move the game on (may include refusals)
//   fallback(state)               -> [actor, msg] | null: the host's neutral skip for this step, if the game has one
//   probes(state, rng)            -> [[actor, msg], ...] in-game actions to try on the end screen (excluding undo)
//   undo(state)                   -> [actor, msg]: the Undo action (host)
//   fingerprint(state)            -> string/JSON of everything a finished game must keep (winner, roles, results...)
//   viewers(state)                -> [viewerId, ...]
//   view(state, viewerId)         -> the object sent to that viewer
//   secretsRevealed(state)        -> boolean: true when the rules reveal everything (game over), skips the leak check
//   secretHolders(state)          -> [playerId, ...] whose secret can be shuffled (empty when the app holds no secrets)
//   withSecrets(state, mapping)   -> clone of state where holder id's secret is replaced by mapping[id]'s secret
//   knowledgeClass(state, viewerId, otherId) -> string: two others with the same class may swap secrets without
//                                 the viewer being allowed to notice. Return null for "viewer knows exactly" (never swapped).
//   normalizeView(view)           -> optional; strip fields that legitimately vary (timestamps). Default identity.
// Options: games (300), maxSteps (3000), seed, fallbackEvery (1 = try the host skip at every state), leakViewers (2 random
//   viewers checked per state; Infinity = all), todo { property: 'pointer to the fix' } for known bugs.
